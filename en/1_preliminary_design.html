        <h3>Building Information Modelling and Geographic Information System<br />Integration for Safety</h3>
        <p>At the preliminary design stage, the integration of Building Information Modelling (BIM) with Geographic
          Information System (GIS) provides a powerful virtual platform that significantly enhances safety planning for
          workers and personnel involved in projects. By enabling a comprehensive review of the development in relation
          to its surrounding environment, this technology allows project teams to identify and assess potential hazards
          early in the design process. Through detailed visualization and spatial analysis, BIM and GIS facilitate the
          evaluation of site access, circulation routes, and proximity to existing infrastructure, helping to optimise
          the layout for safe construction activities and future maintenance. This proactive approach supports the
          segregation of pedestrian and vehicular movements, the identification of risk zones, and the planning of
          emergency access routes, all of which are essential for minimising on-site accidents and ensuring a safe
          working environment throughout the construction and operational phases of the project.</p>

        <h3>Modular Block Design</h3>
        <p>Adopting standardised modular block design enhances construction site safety by minimising variations among
          building blocks. With consistent layouts, workers may gain familiarity in construction procedures, resulting
          in reduced errors and accelerated construction progress. This approach also decreases unexpected deviations in
          design and construction details, hence mitigating potential hazards. Furthermore, standardised layouts enable
          efficient material management, as storage and logistics can be optimised across all blocks. By reducing design
          variations, the risk of construction defects and improper installations is also significantly lowered. Modular
          block design improves both safety and efficiency by encouraging predictability across the project.</p>
