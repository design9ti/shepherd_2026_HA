        <h4>Preliminary Design </h4>
        <p>The Preliminary Design stage forms the critical foundation for ensuring safety in planning and design,
          setting the trajectory for all subsequent project phases. At this stage, the scope and objectives of the
          development are clearly defined, and essential design information needs are identified leveraging advanced
          tools such as Building Information Modelling and Design for Manufacture and Assembly. A comprehensive risk
          assessment is conducted to proactively identify potential hazards that may arise throughout the life cycle of
          the structure, while also considering environmental factors, available resources, and the likelihood of
          successful risk mitigation. The principles of safe design are embedded from the outset, guiding decisions on
          site layout, circulation, accessibility, and integration with the surrounding environment. By adopting a
          holistic and systematic approach during preliminary design, the project team ensures that safety is not an
          afterthought, but an integral part of the planning process ultimately creating built environments that are not
          only functional and sustainable, but also safe and harmonious for all users.

        <h4>Detailed Design</h4>
        <p>Detailed Design is a critical stage in the planning and design process that focuses on refining and
          optimising the project to ensure safety throughout its lifecycle. At this stage, designers modify the
          preliminary design to accommodate stakeholder inputs, thoroughly identify and assess project hazards and
          impacts, and develop multiple design options aligned with the hierarchy of control measures. Detailed Design
          involves rigorous testing, trialing, and evaluation of design solutions to select the optimal approach that
          balances safety, functionality, and practicality. Effective communication and collaboration among all
          stakeholders including maintenance supervisors and end-users are essential to incorporate their perspectives,
          especially regarding future maintenance and operational safety. Designers are responsible for conducting
          comprehensive risk assessments to identify significant hazards and to implement control measures that
          eliminate or reduce risks to the lowest practicable level. This proactive approach not only minimises risks
          during construction but also facilitates safer maintenance and operation, ultimately protecting workers,
          occupants, and the public. Examples of safety-focused design considerations include the use of lighter, safer
          gate mechanisms, waterproofing between wet and electrical service rooms to prevent hazards, adoption of twin
          water tanks to ensure uninterrupted supply and prevent disease, and provision of safe access platforms for
          maintenance work. The Detailed Design stage is thus fundamental to embedding safety into the infrastructure
          and housing we develop, reflecting a commitment to safeguarding health and well-being at work and beyond.

        <h4>Tendering</h4>
        <p>In the tendering stage of a construction project, integrating design for safety is crucial to ensure that
          safety risks are effectively managed from the outset. This stage requires the provision of clear,
          project-specific safety information, including significant hazards and impacts, to enable tenderers to prepare
          comprehensive risk control plans. Tenderers must submit an Outline Safety Plan alongside their bids,
          demonstrating how they will address identified risks, especially those arising from their proposed
          construction methods. Evaluating tenders should go beyond price competitiveness to include a thorough
          assessment of the tenderers’ safety performance and compliance with safety requirements. The awarding of
          contracts must prioritise contractors who can demonstrate robust safety management capabilities, ensuring a
          safe working environment throughout construction. This process fosters collaboration, transparency, and
          continuous improvement in safety practices, aligning with the ultimate goal of zero incidents on site.

        <h4>Construction</h4>
        <p>During the construction stage, ensuring safety is paramount and requires meticulous planning, management, and
          coordination to protect all workers on site from the outset. This phase involves proactive identification and
          control of hazards through comprehensive safety plans, regular risk assessments, and strict adherence to
          safety regulations and standards. Effective communication and cooperation among all stakeholders including
          designers, contractors, and safety personnel are essential to manage the dynamic and complex construction
          environment. Incorporating advanced technologies such as Smart Site Safety Systems enhances real-time
          monitoring and early hazard detection, further reducing risks. Additionally, construction methods and design
          details should be optimised to minimise hazards, such as using prefabrication to reduce work at height and
          ensuring safe handling of materials and equipment. Continuous safety auditing, surprise inspections, and
          safety training programmes reinforce a culture of vigilance and compliance, ultimately fostering a safer
          construction process that safeguards workers’ health and well-being throughout the project lifecycle.
